## Description
This application will serve as my showcase portfolio for the many other applications I have and will create so that employers can judge my coding skills and ability to create and deploy web applications.

I intend to continuously add to this application over the next few months.

The initial tasks set out to create this portfolio website included the following:
- Create a navigation bar
    - Link that navigation bar to the sections below
- Use media query to show different views when displayed either through a computer or a phone
- Add an image of yourself with an (About me) section
- Add a contact me section
- Use titled images that link to deployed applications
    - My applications won't be linked yet (as allowed by my tutor)

What I've learned when developing this application:
- 

## Installation
There are no requirements needed to load this application other than opening it on a web browser via a computer or a phone

## Usage
The only functionality this application has is it's ability to link to external sites that intend to load other portfolio work applications
    - These links are not functional yet
